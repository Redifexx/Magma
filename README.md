## OpenGL Game Development Framework

Magma is a small, modular OpenGL 3D rendering framework that's was made to serve as a template for
OpenGL projects. If anyone wants to learn, experiment, or skip the first steps of making their own game or game engine entirely,
then this project is for you!

## Free + Open Source

Magma is ALL YOURS. It has the MIT license so feel free to do with it as you please. My intention was to have a repository that I can copy
into various game related projects of mine.

## How to Use

1. Clone Repository, preferably when first opening Visual Studio
2. With the folder opened in VS, go to File -> Open -> CMake Project
3. Navigate to the repository's CMakeLists.txt and select it
4. You're all set! Give some time for the CMake build system to load before starting the application.

Build settings can be found in CMakeLists.txt.


## Documentation

None. I hope my comments are enough :)

## Demo

I have set up a demo scene utilizing every component that's included to hopefully give users a headstart
into understanding and making the code their own. (Demo song used - Pick It Up by Michael Wyckoff)
